  <h1>My Cookie Company</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Deliciousness in every bite!</h2>
    <p><u>Every</u> cookie made at my Cookie Company is crafted with only the finest ingredients. Butter from grass fed
      cows.
      Unbleached flour with the best flavor and textures. Organic sugar only from India. Eggs from chickens that listen
      to
      classical music. Even water is special. It comes from the Cascade Mountain springs that we hike up to retrieve.
    </p>
    <p>Baking is our passion and we take it very seriously.</p>
